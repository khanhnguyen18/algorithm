- There are N potholes on a straight road parallel to the y-axis.
- The positions of the potholes are described by two arrays of integers, X and Y.
- The K-th pothole (for K within the range (O..N-1]) is located at coordinates (X[K] Y(K]).
In order to fix the potholes, a road roller of width W will be used. The road roller can only drive along the street (parallel to the y-axis). It can start driving from any x coordinate at the beginning of the road (a point whose y coordinate is equal to 0). During one drive, for a chosen starting point (x, 0) of the road roller's left end, the road roller drives upwards and patches all potholes on its way that fall within the width of the road roller, W, and are to the right of its starting position, x. In other words, it patches all the potholes whose first coordinate is between x and x+W inclusive.
What is the minimum number of road roller drives required to patch all the potholes?
Write a function:
class Solution { public int solution(int() X, int(] Y, int M): y
that, given two arrays of integers X and Y, describing the positions of the N potholes, and an integer W, specifying the width of the road roller, returns the minimum number of drives needed to patch all the potholes.
Examples:
1. Given X = (2, 4, 2, 6, 7, 1L Y = (0, 5, 3, 2, 1, 5) and W = 2, the answer is 3. At least three drives will be needed to patch all the potholes. For example, the drives could start
   respectively at points (1, 0), (4, 0) and (6, 0). During the first drive, the road roller would patch the potholes located at (2, 0), (2, 3) and (1, 5). During the second drive, the potholes located at (4, 5) and (6, 2) would be patched. Finally, in the third drive, the pothole located at (7, 1) would be patched.

- A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. 
- This array contains a decimal representation of a number V, 
- i.e. element A[K] contains the K-th least significant digit of the decimal representation of V.

- For example, array A such that:
A[O]= 3
A[1]= 5
A[2]= 1
represents the number V = 153.
Write a function:
```java
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
```
Given an array A consisting of N integers specifying a decimal representation of a number V, returns the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the number 17*V.
- For example, given array A such that:
A[0] = 3
A[1] = 5
A[2] = 1
the function should return 9, because:
- array A represents the number 153,
- 17 * 153 = 2601,
- the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of 2601 is 2 + 6 + 0 + 1 = 9.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
- N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000);
- each element of array A is an integer within the range (0..9).
